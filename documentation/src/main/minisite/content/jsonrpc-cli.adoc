= JSON-RPC CLI

[abstract]
JSON-RPC CLI module enables you to write a command line application re-using JSON-RPC programming model.

== Dependency

To get started and have the right classpath, start by adding this dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.yupiik.uship</groupId>
  <artifactId>jsonrpc-cli</artifactId>
  <version>${uship.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

== Write a command

To write an user command, just write a JSON-RPC endpoint as usual:

[source,java]
----
@JsonRpc
@ApplicationScoped
public class SampleCommand {
    @JsonRpcMethod(name = "my-command")
    public MyResponse command(@JsonRpcParam("first") final MyRequest request) {
        return ....;
    }
}
----

IMPORTANT: as it uses Âµship CDI integration, don't forget a `META-INF/beans.xml` in your resources (it can be empty) to enable the module scanning.

== Launch the CLI

You can use any `main` and handle the command execution with `io.yupiik.uship.jsonrpc.cli.api.JsonRpcCliExecutor` to execute the command once the arguments parsed.

However, `io.yupiik.uship.jsonrpc.cli.main.JsonRpcCli` provides a default `main` with these features:

* Script handling using `-f` (or `--file`): each line not starting with a `#` or being empty will be parsed and executed as a command,
* Container log lines are hidden until their level is severe enough (INFO are skipped) making it more CLI friendly,
* CDI container uses default discovery (scanning).

Usage:

[source,bash]
----
java \
  -cp $classpath \
  io.yupiik.uship.jsonrpc.cli.main.JsonRpcCli \
  $command \
  $parameters
----

== Parameters

The parameters of the command are passed using the form `$name $value`. It means that you must always have pairs of arguments (`a b c` will fail because it missed a fourth parameter).

The parameters are bound as a JSON-RPC request using the parameter type as indicator, if a primitive the value is directly used, if a class or list it is handled using a properties syntax, etc...

=== Properties syntax

The properties syntax uses a flattenized form of objects/simple lists:

[source,java]
----
public class Nested {
    private String name;
    private List<String> list;
}
public class Root {
    private Nested nested;
}
----

To configure this model, for example, you will use these properties - assuming the parameter of type `Root` is passed to the JSON-RPC method and named `root`:

[source,properties]
----
root.nested.name = xxx
root.nested.list.0 = yyy
root.nested.list.1 = zzz
----

TIP: for list of objects `$list.$index.$nestedAttribute` format is used.

From the command line, `.` can be replaced by `-` to make it CLI friendly (previous example would look like: `--root-nested-name MyName` for example).

== Streams injections

`stdout` and `stderr` can be injected in commands using `@StdOut @Inject PrintStream stdout;` or `@StdErr @Inject PrintStream stderr;`.

It is often needed when you want to output data using streaming instead of passing the data to the result of the command.
